Basic Responsive Navbar Project 
This project demonstrates the creation of a basic responsive navigation bar using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The navbar is designed to provide a clean, modern user interface that adapts smoothly to different screen sizes, ensuring an optimal user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

The navigation bar includes a logo section, multiple menu links (Home, About, Services, Blog, and Contact), and a hamburger toggle button for smaller screens. On larger screens, the menu items are displayed horizontally, while on smaller screens, the navbar converts into a slide-in vertical menu controlled by the toggle button.

CSS is used to style the navbar with features such as flexbox layout, hover effects, smooth transitions, blurred background, and sticky positioning so the navbar remains visible while scrolling. JavaScript adds interactivity by enabling the toggle functionality and animating the hamburger icon into a close icon when activated.

Overall, this project showcases the fundamentals of responsive web design, DOM manipulation, and mobile-first navigation, making it a great starting point for beginners learning modern front-end development.
